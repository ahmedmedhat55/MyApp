               <h2>ROBOTICS</h2>
               <p>Industry leaders still can’t agree on what the term “robot” embodies. Roboticists understand robots to be programmable machines that carry out tasks, but nobody can pinpoint exactly where that definition ends.

                Today's AI-powered robots, or at least those machines deemed as such, possess no natural general intelligence, but they are capable of solving problems and "thinking" in a limited capacity.
                
                From working on assembly lines at Tesla to teaching Japanese students English, examples of artificial intelligence in the field of robotics are plentiful.</p>
               <p>Technologies are being developed that have the potential to support marine mining in all stages from prospection to decommissioning. These developments will likely have substantial influence in the oil and gas industry, itself searching for ways to maximize exploitation of assets.</p>
               <p>Increasing Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Intelligence. Commercial off-the-shelf AUVs rely mostly on acoustic and inertial sensors for their navigation. Speed measurements from a Doppler velocity log are combined with orientation values from gyroscopes and accelerometers to estimate current position. These updates are sometimes augmented by absolute-position fixes from an ultrashort baseline system. However, during such a mission, the inspection assets might not be located exactly at their expected positions. This might be because of incorrect positioning during installation, objects being dragged off location by fishermen, or sediments hiding a pipeline gradually from the view of standard sensors. Therefore, equipping modern AUVs with sensors and software that can search for, detect, track, and reacquire inspection targets is essential.</p>
               <p>Seafloor AUV Support Infrastructure. Current AUVs have limited endurance, mostly because of limited battery capacity. Depending on the sensor suite, onboard data-storage space also can be a limiting factor. This causes AUV missions to run no longer than a few days at most, depending on AUV size and shape, propulsion, sensor efficiency, and environmental conditions in the deployment area.To remedy this, current AUV research focuses on subsea docking stations featuring underwater battery charging as well as broadband data links. Depending on the desired charging time, either inductive energy transfer or underwater-pluggable connectors are used. While both require precise positioning, the latter allows for higher charging currents but also requires a more-complex and higher-force plugging mechanism. To transfer inspection results from the AUV and upload new missions, a high-bandwidth data link is required. To charge its battery and transfer data, the AUV has to find its way back home and correctly execute the docking process autonomously. In this application, a combination of dock-relative positioning sensors are used.</p>
               <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are a powerful combination for automating tasks inside and outside of the factory setting. In recent years, AI has become an increasingly common presence in robotic solutions, introducing flexibility and learning capabilities in previously rigid applications.

                While AI is still in its nascent stages, it’s been a transformative technology for some applications in the manufacturing sector, although there are many that have yet to feel the impact.</p>

        <h2>How Artificial Intelligence is Used in Today’s Robots</h2>
               <p>In today’s global manufacturing sector, there are a few main ways in which AI is deployed.</p>
               <p>When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.
                    Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Assembly</h2>
            <p>AI is a highly useful tool in robotic assembly applications.<br> When combined with advanced vision systems,<br> AI can help with real-time course correction,<br> which is particularly useful in complex manufacturing sectors like aerospace. <br>AI can also be used to help a robot learn <br>on its own which paths are best for certain <br>processes while it’s in operation.</p>

            <h2>Packaging</h2>
            <p>Robotic packaging uses forms of AI frequently for quicker, lower cost and more accurate packaging. AI helps save certain motions a robotic system makes, while constantly refining them, which makes installing and moving robotic systems easy enough for anybody to do.</p>

            <h2>Customer Service</h2>
            <p>Robots are now being used in a customer service<br> capacity in retail stores <br>and hotels around the world. Most of these <br>robots leverage AI natural language processing abilities<br> to interact with customers in a more human way. Often, the more these systems can interact with humans, the more they learn. </p>
