               <h2>Google:Smart Map</h2>
               <p>Google and Apple loom so large over the field of digital mapping that itâ€™s understandable why it may seem they represent the beginning and the end of this market. But the demands of a wide range of services such autonomous vehicles and smart cities are giving rise to a new generation of mapping competitors who are pushing the boundaries of innovation.</p>
               <p>The fundamental approach to mapping used by the two giants, mixing satellite imagery and fleets of cars roaming the streets, is becoming archaic and too slow to meet the fast-moving needs of businesses in areas like ecommerce, drones, and forms of mobility. These services often have very specific needs that require real-time updates and far richer data.</p>
               <p>Google Maps triggered a revolution when it was launched in 2005. The embeddable, adaptable mapping service quickly supplanted then-leader Mapquest, which had built its early lead on static maps that provided directions. In 2012, Apple broke with Google to create its own maps, which were initially regarded as a disaster, though they have continued to improve in quality.</p>
               <p>The problem with both models is that the world around them is accelerating faster than these leaders are evolving. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that Google Maps is filled with an estimated 11 million fake business listings, delivering a serious blow to its credibility. In response, Google said it took down 3 million fake listings last year, and continues to step up its efforts, while also insisting fake listings have existed pretty much since printed directories of businesses.</p>

        <h2>Future of digital maps and importance in advanced technologies</h2>
               <p>In the future, autonomous vehicles are the most important end-user of digital maps. Thus, the current digital maps must be updated and improved. In the future, digital maps must dynamically reflect and understand the environment. Moreover, with help of AI and Machine Learning algorithms, it would become easier to find patterns in generated data. For autonomous vehicles to run smoother on the road, we need powerful computing to create maps that offer more accurate data and detailed information regarding every corner, street, road, and lamp-post, than we currently possess.</p>

            <h2>Digital maps and driverless cars</h2>
            <p>The maps that we use daily are not good enough for this task as they are created with GPS and aerial photography. Although they are sufficient for people to drive around the unknown neighborhood, it is not suitable for autonomous vehicles as GPS is accurate to about five meters and that will not keep the autonomous car out of trouble.</p>

            <h2>Digital maps to help navigate smart cities</h2>
            <p>Every industry, every sector is riding the wave of digitization. Increasing urbanization and the number of cities have questioned everyone how to manage environmental resources, mitigate problems of pollution, and how to make societies more accessible. While modern cities are moving toward sustainability and inclusivity, the cartography must get an update of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

            <h2>Advancements in mapping through AI and IoT</h2>
            <p>Thousands of cartographers spend tens of thousands of hours to perfect digital maps by adding data on the ground and reviewing public satellite images. With the help of AI, digital mapping can be done in a short period while improving accuracy and detail.The editor uses AI to make the process faster by proposing AI-generated roads to cartographers and allows them to add map data to OSM.</p>
