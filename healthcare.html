               <h2>HEALTHCARE</h2>
               <p>Artificial intelligence is proving to be a game-changer in healthcare, improving virtually every aspect of the industry from robot-assisted surgeries to safeguarding private records against cyber criminals.Healthcare has long suffered from skyrocketing medical costs and inefficient processes. Artificial intelligence is giving the maligned industry a much-needed makeover.
                AI-enabled virtual assistants are reducing unnecessary hospital visits and giving nurses 20% of their time back in the process; workflow assistants are helping doctors free up 17% of their schedules; pharmaceutical companies are researching lifesaving medicines in a fraction of the time and cost it traditionally takes; and AI is even being used to help bring healthcare to underdeveloped nations.</p>
               <p>What distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gather data, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used</p>
               <p>The role of artificial intelligence in healthcare has been a huge talking point in recent months and there’s no sign of the adoption of this technology slowing down, well, ever really.
                AI in healthcare has huge and wide reaching potential with everything from mobile coaching solutions to drug discovery falling under the umbrella of what can be achieved with machine learning.</p>
               <p>The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has the potential to assist healthcare providers in many aspects of patient care and administrative processes. Most AI and healthcare technologies have strong relevance to the healthcare field, but the tactics they support can vary significantly. </p>

        <h2>How Artificial Intelligence is Used in Today’s Robots</h2>
               <p>Various specialties in medicine have shown an increase in research regarding AI. As the novel coronavirus ravages through the globe, the United States is estimated to invest more than $2 billion in AI related healthcare research over the next 5 years, more than 4 times the amount spent in 2019 ($463 million)</p>
               <p>At the highest level, here are some of the current technological applications of AI in healthcare you should know about (some will be explored further in the article while some use cases have gotten their own standalone articles on HealthcareWeekly already).</p>

            <h2>Radiology</h2>
            <p>A study at Stanford created an algorithm that could detect pneumonia in patients with a better average F1 metric (a statistical metric based on accuracy and recall), than radiologists involved in the trial. Through imaging in oncology, AI has been able to serve well for detecting abnormalities and monitoring change over time; two key factors in oncological health.</p>

            <h2>Screening</h2>
            <p>Recent advances have suggested the use of AI to describe and evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or the assessment of cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance.
                In 2018, a paper published in the journal Annals of Oncology mentioned that skin cancer could be detected more accurately by an artificial intelligence system (which used a deep learning convolutional neural network) than by dermatologists. </p>

            <h2>Psychiatry</h2>
            <p>In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depressionChallenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017.</p>
