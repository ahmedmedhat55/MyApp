               <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>
               <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot 
                to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to
                 the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, 
                 such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.</p>
               <p>Since the 
                development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed
                 to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing 
                 chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing 
               speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human…</p>

        <h2>What is intelligence?</h2>
               <p>All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.
                 What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus.</p>
               <p>When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.
                    Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.…</p>

            <p>Reactive machines are the simplest level of robot.<br> They cannot create memories or use information <br>learnt to influence future decisions – they are only <br>able to react to presently existing situations.</p>

            <p>Human beings have thoughts and feelings,<br> memories or other brain patterns that drive <br>and influence their behaviour. 
                It is based from this<br> psychology that theory of mind researchers work </p>
